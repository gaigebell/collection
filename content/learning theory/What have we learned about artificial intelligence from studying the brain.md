### The current excitement

- brain -> neural networks
- DeepMind, Vicarious, Numenta develop intelligent systems based on understanding the brain
- Intel, IBM invested in **neuromophic computing**
- the Kempner Institute at Harvard University
- the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines at MIT
- the NeuroAI program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

### The innocent eye

- current: computational principles instead of 解剖结构或生物化学 => conceptual difficulty: 原理不会停留在测量数据的表面
- Limitting factor: not our ability to extract structure from data, ×
- but rather our **ability to specify what kind of structure we are looking for in the first place**
- 我们应该在计算框架下进行探究，而非纯粹的生物学研究

### Lessons from history
- McCulloch and Pitts (1943), and later by Rosenblatt (1958), which showed that **neural networks**, loosely inspired by ==biological neurons==, were capable of **logical computation** and **pattern recognition**.
- ==massive parallelism of neural computation==, which inspired **“cooperative” algorithms** for parallel constraint satisfaction (Grimson 1981; Ackley et al. 1985).
- the **convolutional neural network** (convnet), inspired by the organization of ==visual cortex==
- **reinforcement learning**, inspired by ==studies of animal learning==.


### Convolutional neural networks

- In 1980, Fukushima published a seminal paper introducing his neocognitron architecture (Fukushima 1980), which was based on the single-unit recordings of visual cortex reported by Hubel and Wiesel (1959, 1962, 1965).
- The first practical convnet (trained using backpropagation) was developed by LeCun et al. (1989), which they applied to handwritten digit classification.
- With advances in computing power and data set size, convnets came to dominate computer vision (Krizhevsky et al. 2017).
- They subsequently fed back into neuroscience, driving new experimental and theoretical work (Lindsay 2021).




### Convergence
- If engineers propose an algorithm and neuroscientists find evidence for it in the brain, it is a pretty good clue that the algorithm is on the right track
