### History

I have my footprints on the Internet!

I had my personal website many years ago. It was around 2019. The website was used for publishing my first "video game" and introducing my "game studio".

But now, due to the inconvenience of maintenance, it won't be updated anymore.

Before that, I played Olypiad of Informatics in my middle school. My first blog was set up at Luogu then at CSDN. I wrote a lot about solving programming problems and my competetion history in my blog.

After NOIP 2021, I ended my OI career and the blog didn't have any update since then.
