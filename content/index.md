All the contents are edited with [Obsidian]([Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking](https://obsidian.md/)), which is a powerful archives manager. It provides basic Markdown support and rich styles for documentation. Plus, various plugins are provided in the community, better meeting different personal needs and enriching the diversity of writing. 

[Quartz]([jackyzha0/quartz: ðŸŒ± a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites (github.com)](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)) helps me to publish my contents on this site for free. All you need are just Github and Quartz. 

If you also want to build a site like this and publish your Obsidian contents, you can check out [[From Local to Website]]. This content is a tutorial about publishing your Obsidian vaults to a website like this using Quartz.
