THROREM 8 The Invertible Matrix Theorem

Let $A$ be a square $n\times n$ matrix. Then the following statements are equivalent. That is, for a given $A$, the statements are either all true or all false

1. $A$ is an invertible matrix.
2. $A$ is row equivalent to the $n\times n$ identity matrix.
3. $A$ has $n$ pivot positions
4. The equation $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$ has only the trivial solution.
5. The columns of $A$ form a linearly independent set.
6. The linear transformation ${\bf x} \mapsto A{\bf x}$ is one to one
7. The equation $A{\bf x} = {\bf b}$ has at least one solution for each ${\bf b}$ in $\mathbb R^n$
8. The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb R^n$
9. The linear transformation ${\bf x}\mapsto A{\bf x}$ maps $\mathbb R^n$ onto $\mathbb R^n$
10. There is an $n\times n$ matrix $C$ such that $CA = I$
11. There is an $n\times n$ matrix $D$ such that $AD = I$
12. $A^T$ is an invertible matrix
